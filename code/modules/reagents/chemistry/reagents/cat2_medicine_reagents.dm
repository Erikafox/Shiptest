/*
*How this medicine works:
*Penthrite if you are not in crit only stabilizes your heart.
*As soon as you pass crit threshold it's special effects kick in. Penthrite forces your heart to beat preventing you from entering
*soft and hard crit, but there is a catch. During this you will be healed and you will sustain
*heart damage that will not imapct you as long as penthrite is in your system.
*If you reach the threshold of -60 HP penthrite stops working and you get a heart attack, penthrite is flushed from your system in that very moment,
*causing you to loose your soft crit, hard crit and heart stabilization effects.
*Overdosing on penthrite also causes a heart failure.
